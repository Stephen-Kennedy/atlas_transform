### Shutdown

**✅ Wins (3 bullets):**
- 
- 
- 

**🧹 Close the loops:**
- [ ] Inbox zero-ish (email + messages): triage, defer, delegate
- [ ] Update task statuses (check off / reschedule / add due dates)
- [ ] Capture new inputs → Funnel (#quickcap)

**🧠 Tomorrow’s first move:**
- [ ] Identify the ONE Deep Work task for tomorrow (must have #deep)
- [ ] If blocked: write the next physical action + who/what is needed

**⏱️ Meetings sanity check:**
- [ ] Any meetings that ran long / were missing? Note adjustments.

**🧾 End-of-day note:**
-
